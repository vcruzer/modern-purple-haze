# Modern Purple Raze README

A Purple theme that takes inspiration from Default Dark Modern syntax highlights and Synthwave 84 purple tones.

I basically use the non-neon version base colors from Synthwave 84 with code syntax colors from the default Dark Modern VSCode Theme. 
Additionally, I made some all around few tweaks to improve overrall visibility. 

Note that I do not have review the theme for several programming languages, so if you find any visibility issues just open an issue and let's work together.


## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your color theme extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the theme file and specifies the base theme of the theme.
* `themes/purple-haze-color-theme.json` - the color theme definition file.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick your color theme.
* Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these scopes, invoke the `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).

## Make changes

* Changes to the theme file are automatically applied to the Extension Development Host window.

## Install your extension

* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
